# Word-Count

 https://saravanan-mca23.github.io/Word-Count/
 This HTML and JavaScript code analyzes a paragraph, identifies the top three words with the highest frequency of occurrence, and displays them along with their counts in an HTML `<div>`element with the ID "count."
 ## Steps to Run the project
 Step 1: Press "ctrl + shift + i" to open the console.
 Step 2: It returns the most three common words.
 ## Future Improvements
 The project can be further enhanced by adding spell checkers and improves or alters some additional resource.
